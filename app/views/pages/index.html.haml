            #{application_name.capitalize} is all about encouraging users to come forth with their ideas to better the game and community. If you think an item's graphic can be tweaked, by all means post your design on the forums. If a design gets enough positive feedback from the community, we'll put it into the game. Who knows, you may even become a prolific artist whos items are sought after by many.
